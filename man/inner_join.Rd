\title{Wrapper around dplyr::inner_join that prints information about the operation.}
\usage{
inner_join(
  x,
  y,
  by = NULL,
  copy = FALSE,
  suffix = c(".x", ".y"),
  ...,
  keep = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{A pair of data frames, data frame extensions (e.g. a tibble), or
lazy data frames (e.g. from dbplyr or dtplyr). See \emph{Methods}, below, for
more details.}

\item{by}{A join specification created with \code{\link[dplyr:join_by]{join_by()}}, or a character
vector of variables to join by.

If \code{NULL}, the default, \verb{*_join()} will perform a natural join, using all
variables in common across \code{x} and \code{y}. A message lists the variables so
that you can check they're correct; suppress the message by supplying \code{by}
explicitly.

To join on different variables between \code{x} and \code{y}, use a \code{\link[dplyr:join_by]{join_by()}}
specification. For example, \code{join_by(a == b)} will match \code{x$a} to \code{y$b}.

To join by multiple variables, use a \code{\link[dplyr:join_by]{join_by()}} specification with
multiple expressions. For example, \code{join_by(a == b, c == d)} will match
\code{x$a} to \code{y$b} and \code{x$c} to \code{y$d}. If the column names are the same between
\code{x} and \code{y}, you can shorten this by listing only the variable names, like
\code{join_by(a, c)}.

\code{\link[dplyr:join_by]{join_by()}} can also be used to perform inequality, rolling, and overlap
joins. See the documentation at \link[dplyr:join_by]{?join_by} for details on
these types of joins.

For simple equality joins, you can alternatively specify a character vector
of variable names to join by. For example, \code{by = c("a", "b")} joins \code{x$a}
to \code{y$a} and \code{x$b} to \code{y$b}. If variable names differ between \code{x} and \code{y},
use a named character vector like \code{by = c("x_a" = "y_a", "x_b" = "y_b")}.

To perform a cross-join, generating all combinations of \code{x} and \code{y}, see
\code{\link[dplyr:cross_join]{cross_join()}}.}

\item{copy}{If \code{x} and \code{y} are not from the same data source,
and \code{copy} is \code{TRUE}, then \code{y} will be copied into the
same src as \code{x}.  This allows you to join tables across srcs, but
it is a potentially expensive operation so you must opt into it.}

\item{suffix}{If there are non-joined duplicate variables in \code{x} and
\code{y}, these suffixes will be added to the output to disambiguate them.
Should be a character vector of length 2.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed onto methods.}

\item{keep}{Should the join keys from both \code{x} and \code{y} be preserved in the
output?
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL}, the default, joins on equality retain only the keys from \code{x},
while joins on inequality retain the keys from both inputs.
\item If \code{TRUE}, all keys from both inputs are retained.
\item If \code{FALSE}, only keys from \code{x} are retained. For right and full joins,
the data in key columns corresponding to rows that only exist in \code{y} are
merged into the key columns from \code{x}. Can't be used when joining on
inequality conditions.
}}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as \code{x} (including the same groups). The order of
the rows and columns of \code{x} is preserved as much as possible. The output has
the following properties:
\itemize{
\item The rows are affect by the join type.
\itemize{
\item \code{inner_join()} returns matched \code{x} rows.
\item \code{left_join()} returns all \code{x} rows.
\item \code{right_join()}  returns matched of \code{x} rows, followed by unmatched \code{y} rows.
\item \code{full_join()}  returns all \code{x} rows, followed by unmatched \code{y} rows.
}
\item Output columns include all columns from \code{x} and all non-key columns from
\code{y}. If \code{keep = TRUE}, the key columns from \code{y} are included as well.
\item If non-key columns in \code{x} and \code{y} have the same name, \code{suffix}es are added
to disambiguate. If \code{keep = TRUE} and key columns in \code{x} and \code{y} have
the same name, \code{suffix}es are added to disambiguate these as well.
\item If \code{keep = FALSE}, output columns included in \code{by} are coerced to their
common type between \code{x} and \code{y}.
