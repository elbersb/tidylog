\title{Wrapper around dplyr::filter_all that prints information about the operation.}
\usage{
filter_all(.tbl, .vars_predicate, .preserve = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.tbl}{A \code{tbl} object.}

\item{.vars_predicate}{A quoted predicate expression as returned by
\code{\link[dplyr:all_vars]{all_vars()}} or \code{\link[dplyr:any_vars]{any_vars()}}.

Can also be a function or purrr-like formula. In this case, the
intersection of the results is taken by default and there's
currently no way to request the union.}

\item{.preserve}{when \code{FALSE} (the default), the grouping structure
is recalculated based on the resulting data, otherwise it is kept as is.}
